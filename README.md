# Grav Portfolio

My own approach to building a design portfolio using Grav.

## Why Grav?
After having worked with Wordpress for a bunch of clients, I had a clear idea that I wouldn't want to touch it with a ten foot pole when it came to my personal site. Don't get me wrong, Wordpress is great for some use cases, but fails well short in performance and flexibility.

Somebody mentioned Grav to me when explaining the concept of a flat-file CMS and I immediately fell in love with the idea. Extensible, quick, lightweight and portable? That's all I need really.
